slug: preparing-for-technical-interviews

Alright, so I’ve been procrastinating long enough on the LeetCode grind. 5 years into my career as a software engineer and I’ve managed to evade the all harrowing technical interview which unfortunately, has only increased my anxiety and made the mountain to climb even that much larger. In this current job market, I know that finding a job will not be no easy feat, so I’m doing my best to prepare as much as I can and starting this series to keep myself accountable, share anything useful I find, and maybe get some support? We’ll see how this goes…

My strategy will be to start with the Neetcode 150, and see how badly bomb those questions before moving on to something else. Truth be told, I’ve already wasted a lot of money on buying different resources, in hopes to find the “one to rule them all”, but have found no such resource.
